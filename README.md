The part handling the floats is hideous and messy, I do not recommend anyone to look into for inspiration, but rather to see what should never append in your code, or as an example of what comms out from bad "architecture" decisions.
The rest of the code is OK, but I could do a lot better if only I've had understood printf more thoroughly before starting the coding phase.
Please do better than me.
